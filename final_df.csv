    The Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College, is proud to present Dark Moves: Fabiola Menchelli & Heather Watkins. This intimate exhibition consists of newly-commissioned work by Mexico City artist Fabiola Menchelli and Northwest artist Heather Watkins.  Nestled in the Reed College library, the gallery is free and open to the public. Families are welcome!

Menchelli and Watkins are artists deeply invested in the sensory and perceptual possibilities of light—along with its orbital complements, darkness and shadow. With artistic methodologies drawn from poetry, cosmogony, and scientific experimentation, the artists modulate the luminal in pursuit of unknown outcomes. Resultant forms of disappearance, reversal, and refraction communicate across the entirety of the Cooley—particularly in the center, where a hexagonal room with open ends echoes the internal angles and shadows of Menchelli and Watkins’ work.​​ As viewers move through, and around, the hexagon, their bodies draw the symbol of the lemniscate—the infinity symbol (∞). Dark Moves seeks to emulate the ways that shadow becomes a medium in the artists’ hands—contouring, obscuring, and unfolding their work across the deep, azure walls of the museum. 

Menchelli and Watkins employ color, line, and saturation—dematerializing modernist geometries, and transforming planarity into ascending angles and curves. Their experiments produce enigmatic effects and lacunae—voids and folds that touch and trace one another. In Dark Moves, Menchelli brings new dimensionality to her translucent color photograms, made entirely in the dark—folding and manipulating the photosensitive paper. These alchemical agents become embodied sculptures mounted on a stainless steel substructure that thrust their geometric volumes, casting shadows on the wall. In the darkened surroundings of the space, Watkins transforms the dynamic linearity of her ink-based drawings into rising, swooping organic forms that radiate wild shadows. These sculptural forms accompany numinous gold reliefs created by imperceptible forces, and small works on paper that oscillate between a fluid lyricism and darker visions of interior compression.

Over the last two years, the artists and the curator have engaged in an extensive collaborative process, working between Portland and Mexico City. This ongoing conversation has shaped every aspect of the exhibition and its extended programing, including the forthcoming catalog by Mexico City designer Priscila Vanneuville.

In Dark Moves, seeing is not believing. Here, to “see” is to search for ways of knowing that may only be accessed through shadow, the subconscious, and the ancient iconographies of pleasure and pain at the heart of the visual imagination. 

Heather Watkins holds an MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design, and a dual BA in English & World Literature and Classical Studies, from Pitzer College (Claremont, CA). She has received numerous grants from organizations including: the Oregon Arts Commission; the Ford Family Foundation; and the Regional Arts & Culture Council (Portland, OR); and has been awarded residencies at Caldera (Sisters, OR); the Sitka Center for Art & Ecology (Otis, OR); Stelo Arts (Portland, OR); and Township10 (Marshall, NC).

    Dr. Adam Jones studies the sexual selection and functional genomics of fish in the Syngnathidae family that includes seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons.

The Genomics of Seahorses and Pipefishes

The fish family Syngnathidae includes pipefishes, seahorses, and seadragons. These species are unique among animals in that the males become pregnant. That is, during mating, the female transfers eggs to the male's body, where they are fertilized. The offspring are carried by the male until they are born as free-swimming, independent young. The phenomenon of male pregnancy has made these fishes a group of special interest for the study of sexual selection. These fishes also exhibit striking variation in overall morphology. These unique characteristics, including substantial divergence and convergent evolution, make this group appealing for comparative purposes. I will discuss how basic research on syngnathid fishes, combined with recent technological advances, have allowed us to turn the family Syngnathidae into a model system for comparative genomics and sexual selection research.

"https://events.reed.edu/event/nova_pangaea_album_release_concert","Sunday, April 16, 2023 3pm","“NOVA PANGAEA” | ALBUM RELEASE CONCERT","
    Nova Pangaea is a stunning testament to the beauty of our planet and the urgency of the climate crisis. The Portland-based flutist and saxophonist, John C. Savage, has corralled some of Portland’s most adventurous improvisers and created a haunting, yet hopeful, quartet album that masterfully blends jazz, world music, and avant-garde sounds to convey the interconnectedness of our global community and the urgent need for collective action.

From the opening title track, Savage’s flute dances delicately atop the shimmery quartal voicings of Mike Gamble’s guitar. While rhythmic pulses from bassist Shao Way Wu and drummer Ken Ollis evoke the ominous creation of a new, global supercontinent.

“The Great Acceleration” expresses the chaos and tumult of a worsening disaster with a vibe that is as much Ornette Coleman’s Science Fiction sessions as it is John Zorn.

Throughout the album, Savage’s woodwind playing is impressive and moving. For example, his clarinet playing on “Greta and Amira Sit on the Banks of a Mighty River Discussing the Climate Crisis” is pensive and groaning. This tune takes on the ambitious task of imagining a world in which all nations work together to address the climate crisis. The quartet builds to a frenetic climax, conveying both the urgency and the potential of such a unified effort.

Meanwhile, his virtuosic flute improvisations on “4° to Oblivion” demonstrates his deep connection to the instrument and to the collaborative compositional process the band possesses on the freer pieces.

Gamble is equally impressive throughout. A master of timbre and in possession of enviable chops, Gamble demonstrates throughout why he is in such high demand as a player in a wide variety of styles.

But what truly sets “Nova Pangea” apart is its commitment to addressing the climate crisis in both its music and its messaging. Savage has made it clear that he sees his role as a musician not just as a performer, but as an advocate for positive change. The tune titles evoke a lot of imagery and emotional response and the music sees us all through the messaging.

Indeed, “Nova Pangea” is a call to action, a reminder that we are all part of a global community that is facing an existential threat. But it is also a celebration of the beauty and diversity of our planet, a testament to the power of music to connect us all. In Lie Very Still’s hands, music becomes a tool for transformation, a way to imagine and enact a more just and sustainable world.

    We are so glad you are interested in joining our workshop! 

 

This workshop is skills based and experiential. We will practice mindfulness in nature-settings to strengthen your relationship with nature and facilitate reflection, connection, and reciprocity. The outdoor experiential sessions will include walking on uneven and/or muddy paths in the Reed Canyon, and meeting at the Rhododendron Garden near Reed! The outdoor meetings will continue if it is raining (please dress accordingly and bring any personal items such as an umbrella, if desired). In the event of extreme weather, the participants will be contacted directly.

Please plan to attend both sessions if you register. Pre-registration is required for participation in this workshop. Once you have been registered for the workshop we will send materials and information for the workshop via email.

 

Details: 

When: Mondays from 2:30-4:00pm, March 6th and 20th, and April 10th and 17th 

Meeting #1 The what and how skills of nature-based mindfulness. Learning to transition from “thinking” to “sensing” and from “doing” to “being” which will help facilitate nonjudgmental present-moment focus, connection, self-reflection, and centering. Experiential practice of nature-based mindfulness at the Rhododendron garden (students can enter free with Reed ID card).

Meeting #2 Deepening your ecotherapy practice through relational protocols and practicing mindfulness with the canyon at Reed. We will also discuss ancestral introduction, land acknowledgement, and identifying personal proximity to unearned privilege and violence inflicted by colonization. We will explore metaphors to facilitate self-reflection, connection and reciprocity with nature.

    Model Stealing Attacks and Defenses: Where are we now? -
The success of deep learning in many application domains has been nothing short of dramatic. This has brought the spotlight onto security and privacy concerns with machine learning (ML). One such concern is the threat of model theft. I will discuss our work on exploring the threat of model theft, especially in the form of ""model extraction attacks""  -- when a model is made available to customers via an inference interface, a malicious customer can use repeated queries to this interface and use the information gained to construct a surrogate model. I will also discuss possible countermeasures, focusing on deterrence mechanisms that allow for model ownership resolution (MOR). I will touch on the issue of conflicts that arise when protection mechanisms for multiple different threats need to be applied simultaneously to a given ML model, using MOR techniques as a case study.

    The Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery, Reed College, is proud to present Dark Moves: Fabiola Menchelli & Heather Watkins. This intimate exhibition consists of newly-commissioned work by Mexico City artist Fabiola Menchelli and Northwest artist Heather Watkins.  Nestled in the Reed College library, the gallery is free and open to the public. Families are welcome!

Menchelli and Watkins are artists deeply invested in the sensory and perceptual possibilities of light—along with its orbital complements, darkness and shadow. With artistic methodologies drawn from poetry, cosmogony, and scientific experimentation, the artists modulate the luminal in pursuit of unknown outcomes. Resultant forms of disappearance, reversal, and refraction communicate across the entirety of the Cooley—particularly in the center, where a hexagonal room with open ends echoes the internal angles and shadows of Menchelli and Watkins’ work.​​ As viewers move through, and around, the hexagon, their bodies draw the symbol of the lemniscate—the infinity symbol (∞). Dark Moves seeks to emulate the ways that shadow becomes a medium in the artists’ hands—contouring, obscuring, and unfolding their work across the deep, azure walls of the museum. 

Menchelli and Watkins employ color, line, and saturation—dematerializing modernist geometries, and transforming planarity into ascending angles and curves. Their experiments produce enigmatic effects and lacunae—voids and folds that touch and trace one another. In Dark Moves, Menchelli brings new dimensionality to her translucent color photograms, made entirely in the dark—folding and manipulating the photosensitive paper. These alchemical agents become embodied sculptures mounted on a stainless steel substructure that thrust their geometric volumes, casting shadows on the wall. In the darkened surroundings of the space, Watkins transforms the dynamic linearity of her ink-based drawings into rising, swooping organic forms that radiate wild shadows. These sculptural forms accompany numinous gold reliefs created by imperceptible forces, and small works on paper that oscillate between a fluid lyricism and darker visions of interior compression.

Over the last two years, the artists and the curator have engaged in an extensive collaborative process, working between Portland and Mexico City. This ongoing conversation has shaped every aspect of the exhibition and its extended programing, including the forthcoming catalog by Mexico City designer Priscila Vanneuville.

In Dark Moves, seeing is not believing. Here, to “see” is to search for ways of knowing that may only be accessed through shadow, the subconscious, and the ancient iconographies of pleasure and pain at the heart of the visual imagination.

    Pause. Breathe. Consider. Explore. We invite you to find your center, spark your divine imagination, try the world's first search engine, and find wisdom on the winding path of the Reed Labyrinth.

Lars Howlett of Discover Labyrinths is a leading expert in the creation of custom labyrinths from exact replicas of classical and medieval designs to one-of-a-kind installations. Recognized as a passionate speaker and inspiring teacher on the practice of drawing, building, and walking labyrinths, he manages a vast image archive of diverse designs from past projects and journeys to sacred sites around the world. Howlett builds, walks, and photographs labyrinths as a practice in mindfulness. He is a Veriditas faculty member and Certified Advanced Labyrinth Facilitator, having trained with the leader of the labyrinth movement, Lauren Artress, at Grace and Chartres Cathedrals. For three years he was the apprentice to master builder Robert Ferre, learning the art of sacred geometry and his methods of creating proportional and precise Classical and Medieval patterns. In 2015, Howlett launched Discover Labyrinths LLC, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. He inherited his mentor’s custom tools, labyrinth library, and workshop curriculum. In 2017, Howlett was named a master builder by contemporaries in his field.

Labyrinth creation will take place on April 17-18, and the labyrinth will open to the Reed community at noon on April 19 and be in place through Sunday, April 30.

    When we read, what do we hear and why? On Thursday, April 20, join Professor Lucía Martínez Valdivia for a virtual Foster-Scholz Club talk titled “Audiation: Listening to Writing” to answer these questions.At this talk, Associate Professor of English & Humanities Lucía Martínez Valdivia will discuss her current research into the different ways that texts can prompt the audiation—or mind’s ear—of their readers, in some cases exceeding the possibilities of heard sound. From seemingly straightforward features of language like onomatopoeia to less obvious phenomena like subvocalization, the use of white space, and the description of impossible-to-realize sound, this talk will model how we might become aware of and learn to produce new experiences of sound in the mind.

About Lucía Martínez Valdivia, associate professor of English & humanities
Lucía Martínez Valdivia is associate professor of English & humanities at Reed College. She teaches classes on poetry, poetics, aesthetics, and the phenomenology of reading. Her research specializes in histories of poetic forms, and she has written a number of articles on early modern English poetry and prosody, with a particular focus on short-form lines and the interplay of poetic meter, music, and religion. Her current project explores the relationship between the reading of poetry and sound.
